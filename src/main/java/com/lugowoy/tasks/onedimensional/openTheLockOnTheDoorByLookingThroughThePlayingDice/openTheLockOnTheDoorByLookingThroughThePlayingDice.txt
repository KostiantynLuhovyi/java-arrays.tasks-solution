The secret lock for the safe consists of 10 cells arranged in a row, into which it is necessary to insert the playing dice.
But the door is opened only if in any three neighboring cells the sum of the points on the front faces of the cubes is 10.
(The dice has 1 to 6 dots on each face.)
Write a program that unravels the lock code, provided that two dice already inserted in the cells.
