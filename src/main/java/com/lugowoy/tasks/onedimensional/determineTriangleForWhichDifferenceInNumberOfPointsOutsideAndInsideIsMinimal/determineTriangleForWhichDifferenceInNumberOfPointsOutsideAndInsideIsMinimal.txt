In a one-dimensional array with an even number of elements (2N) there are coordinates of N points of the plane.
They are arranged in the following order: x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, etc.
Identify three points that are the vertices of a triangle for which the difference in the number of points outside it and inside is minimal.
